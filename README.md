# Openspending Fiscal Data Types

Used by [os-conductor](https://github.com/openspending/os-conductor) and [os-data-importers](https://github.com/openspending/os-data-importers).

This repository contains:

- The complete list of OS Types, their properties and relationships
- The complete list of descriptions for these types (English only at the moment)
- The logic for converting a list of fields with their types to a full Fiscal Data Package Model
- Logic for validating data against a specific model
- Test suite for making sure everything's working as intended
